            "• \n",
            " Identify Risks, \n",

            "• \n",
            " Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics: \n",
            "( a  ) purpose and objectives of the process; ( b  ) critical success factors for the process; ( c   ) tools and \n",
            "techniques for the process; and ( d   ) documenting the results of the process. \n",
            " 3. A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. \n",
            " This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive, \n",
            "and successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for \n",
            "several reasons: \n",
            " 1.  Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and \n",
            "techniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. \n",
            " 2.  Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk \n",
            "Management. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to \n",
            "apply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is \n",
            "tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There \n",
            "are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of \n",
            "Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. \n",
            " 3.  The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, reﬂ ecting the many \n",
            "business and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures \n",
            "between commercial and national companies, government and non-government organizations, \n",
            "and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. \n",
            " The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization’s processes. Practitioners can \n",
            "establish processes speciﬁ c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with \n",
            "these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice. \n",
            " 1.2 Project Risk Management Deﬁ nition \n",
            " The deﬁ nition of Project Risk Management, as deﬁ ned in the  PMBOK  ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, is the basis \n",
            "for this practice standard: “Project Risk Management includes the processes concerned with conducting \n",
            "risk management planning, identiﬁ cation, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project.” The \n",
            " PMBOK  ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition also states: “The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the \n",
            "probability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the \n",
            "project.” In the  PMBOK  ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, “project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, \n",
            "has a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives.” Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost, \n",
            "and quality. \n",
            " Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide \n",
            "action-oriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may \n",
            "or may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to \n",
            "other dimensions such as their impact on objectives. \n",
            " 1.3 Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management \n",
            " Project Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management. \n",
            "It should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In \n",
            "this way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every \n",
            "process group. \n",
            " Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to ﬁ nal design \n",
            "and from procurement through daily management of execution and close-out. These processes often \n",
            "assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of \n",
            "project risks. \n",
            " Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it \n",
            "builds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates \n",
            "and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. \n",
            "Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates \n",
            "and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project. \n",
            " Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary, \n",
            "Project Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and \n",
            "change management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds \n",
            "the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk \n",
            "into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and \n",
            "schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of conﬁ dence \n",
            "for meeting project objectives. \n",
            " There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project, the level of \n",
            "risk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not \n",
            "mean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different \n",
            "ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the \n",
            "more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. \n",
            " A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project’s life cycle. The earlier in the project life \n",
            "cycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk \n",
            "management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available \n",
            "about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and \n",
            "cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project ﬂ exibility and \n",
            "knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop. \n",
            " It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in \n",
            "place, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. \n",
            "During project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new \n",
            "risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing \n",
            "risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for \n",
            "the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future. \n",
            " Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to \n",
            "contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management \n",
            "practice. \n",

            "the other project management processes. As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be \n",
            "conducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other \n",
            "processes involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is \n",

            "projects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe. \n",
            " Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may \n",

            "• Recognize the Value of Risk Management    — Project Risk Management should be recognized \n",
            "as a valuable discipline that provides a positive potential return on investment for organizational \n",
            "management, project stakeholders (both internal and external), project management, and team \n",
            "members. \n",
            " \n",
            "• Individual Commitment/Responsibility    — Project participants and stakeholders should all accept \n",
            "responsibility for undertaking risk-related activities as required. Risk management is everybody’s \n",
            "responsibility. \n",
            " \n",
            "• Open and Honest Communication    — Everyone should be involved in the Project Risk Management \n",
            "process.  Any actions or attitudes that hinder communication about project risk reduce the effectiveness \n",
            "of Project Risk Management in terms of proactive approaches and effective decision-making. \n",
            " \n",
            "• Organizational Commitment    — Organizational commitment can only be established if risk \n",

            " \n",
            "• Risk Effort Scaled to Project    — Project Risk Management activities should be consistent with the value \n",

            " This chapter introduces the key ideas required to understand and apply Project Risk Management to projects \n",
            "following the approach described in Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK  ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition. These principles and \n",
            "concepts are generally consistent with other approaches to Project Risk Management commonly used although \n",
            "the terminology may differ in some details. \n",
            " The execution of the Project Risk Management process is dealt with in subsequent chapters of this practice \n",
            "standard and so is not discussed here. \n",
            " 2.2 Deﬁ nition of Project Risk \n",
            " The word “risk” is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines. Its use \n",
            "in the  PMBOK  ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process \n",
            "descriptions. The deﬁ nition of project risk given in the  PMBOK  ®  Guide – Fourth Edition is as follows: \n",
            "  Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative \n",
            "effect on a project’s objectives. \n",
            " This deﬁ nition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a project’s objectives. When \n",
            "assessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty \n",
            "dimension may be described using the term “probability” and the effect may be called “impact” (though other \n",
            "descriptors are possible, such as “likelihood” and “consequence”). \n",
